# Actionable Notifications Subflow for iOS
Actionable Notifications Node-Red Subflow for Home Assistant Companion - iOS

This was originally a gist [link](https://gist.github.com/sstratoti/8021c5a4ee8e34313c3f59ba20c4a83a) but I felt that a true github project would help with those that would like to submit issues, questions or pull requests. This way we can manage the code all in one place and people can follow it for updates.

This is a subflow I created that is based originally on the [actionable-notifications-subflow-for-android](https://zachowj.github.io/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/cookbook/actionable-notifications-subflow-for-android.html) that is in the Home Assistant Node-Red cookbook.

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/sstratoti/actionable-notifications-subflow-for-ios/wiki) for information about installation, updating, documentation and examples.
